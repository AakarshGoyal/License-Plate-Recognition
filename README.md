# License-Plate-Recognition

This Project of automatic character recognition is used to detect Indian number plates from even the busiest streets and predict them to monitor unusual activities.

Additional features may include the detection from a wide spectrum of multiple plates in a single frame to even video processing.

With new methods of yolo, CNN, open cv and a self-trained model we were able to achieve a validation accuracy of 96.7% and testing accuracy of 92%.
